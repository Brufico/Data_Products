## Motivation

Brian Caffo: Regression models (Week 3 - lecture "Model Selection part 1"): https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-models/lecture/GOe0R/model-selection-part-i

"What happens if we omit a variable that we should have included? The general result is that it results in bias. In other words, if you're interested in [...] a particular regressor and you've omitted something that's correlated with that regressor, then you're potentially going to get bias. [...] You're not going to get an accurate estimate of what you want to estimate, because of this other variable."

This Shiny app proposes an exploration of a situation in which the omission of one important variable causes the sign of the coefficient of another variable to change, producing a biased and potentially misleading result.


## The situation

The Story an data are borrowed from the book "Analyse des donn√©es", by Jean de Lagarde.

In this situation, a manager wishes to explain the variation in sales in several sect
ors by the advertising expense, and , possibly, by the activity of the sales representatives of the company.

In this situation, there is an obvious causal relationship between the two predictors (Sales representatives visits and Advertising expenses) and the response. Consequently, When a simple recression model is fit it is very odd to find a strong  negative correlation between the advertising expenses and the sales.
One has to include the second variable to get credible model.


## The app: Principles

The app presents the situation, along with

* simple-regression models with each predictor considered alone. for each model, a scatterplot with the corresponding regression line fitted is shown.
* a scatterplot matrix, which could help to explain the reason of the surprising result.

Then, on a separate tabb, a 3D scatterplot, with a regression plane fitted, is made accessible to the user. The user can change the viewing angles of this 3D representation, and discover how the correlation of the two predictors induces a misleading bias if one omits the sales representatives activity predictor from the model.
