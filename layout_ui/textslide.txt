(Example borrowed from Lagarde, Jean, "L'analyse des donn√©es")
Marketing Mix
A company has just launched a promotional campaign. A first report lists, for each of the 8 sales sectors, the sales volume, the advertising budget and the number of visits to the distributors made by the sales representatives. The data is shown below (left tab "data")
 
In order to analyze the effectiveness of the campaign, the manager has tried to explain the sales volume using two regresion models:
* sales ~ advertising
* sales ~ visits
You can view the two scatterplots by clicking on the "simple regresions" tabs on the left). Do you see something very odd with at least one of these scatterplots / regression models ?

A double regresion model has also been made. You can manipulate the corresponding 3D scatterplot (and regression plane) by clicking the tab "multiple regression" (on top).
By changing the view angles, can you explain the odd result you got before?
